    "NumPy is ideal for handling large amounts of homogeneous (same-type) data, offering significant improvements in speed and memory efficiency. It also provides high-level syntax for a wide range of numerical operations, making it a powerful tool for scientific computing and data processing on the CPU.\n",

    "2.Compare and contrast np.mean() and np.average() functions in NumPy. When would you use one over the other?\n",
    "Ans. In NumPy, both np.mean() and np.average() are used to calculate the average of array elements, but they differ in functionality and use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Basic Functionality:\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.mean(): Calculates the arithmetic mean (simple average) of the elements in an array.\n",
    "    np.average(): Calculates the weighted average of the array elements if weights are provided. Without weights, it computes the arithmetic mean, \n",
    "                    similar to np.mean().\n",
    "\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Syntax:\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.mean\n",
    "    np.mean(a, axis=None, dtype=None, out=None, keepdims=False)\n",

    "\n",
    "    np.average()\n",
    "    np.average(a, axis=None, weights=None, returned=False)\n",
    "\n",
    "    Weights Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.mean(): Does not support weights; it always calculates a simple arithmetic mean.\n",
    "    np.average(): Can calculate a weighted average when the weights parameter is provided. The weights determine the contribution of each element to the\n",
    "                    total average.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "        import numpy as np\n",
    "        data = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "        weights = np.array([1, 2, 3, 4])\n",
    "        \n",
    "        np.mean(data)  # Output: 2.5\n",
    "        np.average(data, weights=weights)  # Output: 3.0 (Weighted average)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Return of Weights Sum:\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.average(data, weights=weights, returned=True)\n",
    "    # Output: (3.0, 10.0)  # 3.0 is the weighted average, 10.0 is the sum of weights\n",
    "\n",
    "    Axis Handling:\n",
    "\n",
    "    Both functions support the axis argument, allowing you to calculate the mean or average along a specified axis of a multi-dimensional array.\n",
    "    Example:\n",
    "\n",
    "    arr = np.array([[1, 2], [3, 4]])\n",
    "    np.mean(arr, axis=0)  # Output: array([2., 3.])\n",
    "    np.average(arr, axis=0)  # Output: array([2., 3.])\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "    Performance Considerations:\n",
    "\n",
    "    np.mean(): Faster and simpler for calculating the arithmetic mean, since it doesn’t handle weights.\n",
    "    np.average(): Slightly slower due to the overhead of handling the weights argument, even if weights aren’t provided.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "     When to Use np.mean():\n",
    "\n",
    "    Simple Arithmetic Mean: If you need to compute the average of all elements in an array and each element has equal importance, use np.mean().\n",
    "    \n",
    "    Example: Calculating the average temperature for a week (where each day has equal importance).\n",
    "    Reason: It’s simpler, faster, and doesn’t require the overhead of handling weights.\n",
    "    Performance Priority: When performance is a concern and you don’t need weighted averages, np.mean() is typically faster than np.average() because \n",
    "    it doesn’t process weights.\n",
    "\n",
    "    When to Use np.average():\n",
    "\n",
    "        Weighted Average: Use np.average() when you need to compute a weighted average, meaning different elements in the array contribute differently          to the final result.\n",
    "    \n",
    "        Example: Calculating a student’s final grade where assignments, quizzes, and exams have different weightages (e.g., assignments = 30%, exams =            70%).\n",
    "        Reason: np.mean() does not support weights, so np.average() is necessary to handle weighted contributions.\n",
    "        Need Sum of Weights: If you also need to return the sum of the weights along with the average, np.average() can return both when you set                returned=True.\n",
    "        \n",
    "        Example: In financial applications where you calculate weighted returns, knowing the sum of weights can be useful."
